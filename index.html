<h2>Portfolio tasks</h2>

<div class="myWeek1" id="outer1">
    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <p>For the first week's portfolio task, we had to choose two graphs from <a href="https://github.com/RDeconomist/RDeconomist.github.io/tree/main/charts">the Rapid Charts repository</a>. I chose to look at the change in the Bank of England's target inflation over the past 12 months and it's policy rate.</p>

    <div id="inner1">
        <h3>Change in Inflation</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>
    </div>

    <div id="inner2">
        <h3>BoE policy rate</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart2"></div>
    </div>

    <p>The first chart tracks the change in inflation over the past 12 months in percents. The second chart tracks the Bank of England's policy rate.</p>
</div>  

<div class="week2" id="outer1">
    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <div class="textright">
        <p>This week we looked at an FT chart showing total IMF lending in billions of USD from 1984 to today. 
            In class, we discussed the fact that it might not show an accurate picture of the situaton because of inflation.
            Therefore, we wanted to divide IMF lending by World GDP to get a better sense of when countries should've gotten loans.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="chartright" id="Chart3"></div>

    <div class="chartleft" id="Chart4" style="margin-top:20px"></div>
    <div class="textright">
        <p>Whilst we may have thought that it would have been better to get a loan from the IMF in 1984, we can now clearly see in
            the second chart that although the IMF is lending more, comparatively the world is in a much better state than it was in 1984.

    <h2>Week 3</h2> 
    <p>This week, we had to create a chart where the data would be embedded in the code, instead of having to refer to an additional URL.</p>

    <h3>Maturity and yields of different bonds</h3>

    <div id="inner">
        <h3>Bar Chart</h3>
    <div class="chart" id="Chart5"></div></div>

    <div id="inner">
        <h3>Line Chart</h3>
    <div class="chart" id="Chart6"> </div></div>
    <p>The second chart is more precise in showing the small variations of the yields of bonds as the bars do not obscure the tiny increases and decreases in yield.</p>
    </div>

<div class="myWeek1">
    <h2>Week 4</h2>
    <p>This week we had to build a graph using data we scraped off of a website. I looked at the average electricity usage per year per capita across the world as it is relevant for my project.
        Hover your mouse over the bars to see the corresponding country and value.
    </p>

    <h3>Average consumption of electricity per year per capita in kWh</h3>

<div class="week2">
    <h2>Week 5</h2>
    <p>This week we had to build a dashboard of 9 graphs about the UK's economy. 
        I chose to do graphs about: current government receipts, expenditure, investment, borrowing, government stock, net social benefits, taxes on income and wealth, and tax on VAT. 
        Here is my <a href="">Colab</a> notebook.

<div class="myWeek1">
    <h2>Week 7</h2>
    <p>Our task this week was to create first a simple map of a geographical location using a geojson file and then plot some data on it. As you hover over each country, you should see a tooltip appear.
        I chose to look at a map of Europe and to plot the energy consumption per capita for every single country.

        This week's task was to produce two charts that use advanced analytics. The first graph is a scatter plot that looks at whether the percentage of renewablle energy used in European countries is correlated with its GDP per capita. The
