<div class="myWeek1" id="outer1">
    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <p>For the first week's portfolio task, we had to choose two graphs from <a href="https://github.com/RDeconomist/RDeconomist.github.io/tree/main/charts">the Rapid Charts repository</a>. I chose to look at the change in the Bank of England's target inflation over the past 12 months and it's policy rate.</p>

    <div id="inner1">
        <h3>Change in Inflation</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>
    </div>

    <div id="inner2">
        <h3>BoE policy rate</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart2"></div>
    </div>

    <p>The first chart tracks the change in inflation over the past 12 months in percents. The second chart tracks the Bank of England's policy rate.</p>
</div>  

<div class="week2" id="outer1">
    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <div class="textright">
        <p>This week we looked at an FT chart showing total IMF lending in billions of USD from 1984 to today. 
            In class, we discussed the fact that it might not show an accurate picture of the situaton because of inflation.
            Therefore, we wanted to divide IMF lending by World GDP to get a better sense of when countries should've gotten loans.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="chartright" id="Chart3"></div>

    <div class="chartleft" id="Chart4" style="margin-top:20px"></div>
    <div class="textright">
        <p>Whilst we may have thought that it would have been better to get a loan from the IMF in 1984, we can now clearly see in
            the second chart that although the IMF is lending more, comparatively the world is in a much better state than it was in 1984.

<div class="myWeek1" id="outer">
    <h2>Week 3</h2> 
    <p>This week, we had to create a chart where the data would be embedded in the code, instead of having to refer to an additional URL.
        I chose to look at the maturity and yields of different bonds
    </p>

    <div id="inner">
    <div class="chart" id="Chart5"></div></div>

    <div id="inner">
    <div class="chart" id="Chart6"> </div></div>
    <p>The second chart is more precise in showing the small variations of the yields of bonds as the bars do not obscure the tiny changes in yield.</p>
    </div>

<div class="myWeek1">
    <h2>Week 4</h2>
    <p>This week we had to build a graph using data we scraped off of a website.
         I looked at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption">average electricity usage per year per capita</a> across the world as it is relevant for my project. Here is my <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iecmT1dO2lFqY7zk1ATvGxB0n3fV8ih2?usp=sharing">Colab notebook</a>.
        Hover your mouse over the bars to see the corresponding country and value.
    </p>

    <h3>Average consumption of electricity per year per capita in kWh</h3>
    <div class="chartweek4" id="Chart7"></div>
    </div>

<div class="week2">
    <h2>Week 5</h2>
    <p>This week we had to build a dashboard of 9 graphs about the UK's economy. I downloaded the data from an API using the following <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VCO9Q0ZbRBFheicwhCldgg_nN8UA1IJo?usp=sharing">Colab notebook</a>.
        I chose to do graphs about: current government receipts, expenditure, investment, borrowing, government stock, net social benefits, taxes on income and wealth, and tax on VAT.

    <h2>Week 6 - Reading Week</h2>
</div>

<div class="myWeek1">
    <h2>Week 7</h2>
    <p>Our task this week was to create first a simple map of a geographical location using a geojson file and then plot some data on it. As you hover over each country, you should see a tooltip appear.
        I chose to look at a map of Europe and to plot the energy consumption per capita for every single country.

<div class="myWeek1">
    <h2>Week 8</h2>
    <p>This week we had to attend a talk at the Festival of Economics and create to graphs refutting or consolidating an argument the speakers talked about. i went to the talk about big data and I was interested in what Arthur Turrell from the ONS mentionned about inflation measures. 
        He argued that the poorest people experience a much higher level of inflation as they buy a different basket of goods than the one looked at by the ONS when calculating the level of inflation.
        I wanted to look at a graph showing the evolution of the price of different baskets fo goods, indexed for April 2021, and then at another graph showing by how much different food and non-alcoholic beverages' prices grew since April 2021.
    </p>
    <div class="chart" id="Chart19"></div>
    <div class="chart" id="Chart20"></div>
    <p>We can see that whilst the lowest cost grocery basket inflation is in line with the other two measures, it is usually above the simple 'Food and Non-alcoholic beverages' basket. This is exacerbated by the fact that the lowest-income households usually have to save money in order to afford essentials like food, heating, rent. Therefore, they will feel this inflation more than other households.
        <br> <br>The second chart shows that most points are concentrated around the 0 to 0.15 rate of price change. The red dot shows the 12-month rate of inflation, which is also in the same area as most are concentrated in. We do not really observe a relation between the price of that item in April 2021 and the growth rate of its price, but we can see that quite a few of the items with high rates of change belong to the same food groups.

<div class="myWeek1">
    <h2>Week 9</h2>
    <p>
        This week's task was to produce two charts that use advanced analytics. The first figure is a trellis chart of gas and electricity prices for both household and non-household consumers form 1990 to 2020 in a few countries and across the EU. The second is a heatmap of energy consumption in Europe.

<div class="myWeek1">
    <h2>Week 10 & 11</h2>
    <p> During these two weeks, we learnt about Machine Learning. I wanted to look at whether there was a relationship between GDP and the percentage of renewabe energy a country in the EU used for the supervised learning part.
        For the unsupervised learning, I tried to look at whether it would be possible to group those same countries depending on their usage of renewable energy.<br>
        I collected data from Eurostat and ran a regression in Stata. The first graph shows a slight positive relationship. However, most countries do not fall on the line of best fit (with the exception of Lithuania). 
        For the second part, I ran a K-Means program on <a href="">Colab</a>. However, I could not figure out how to get it to group the countries based on their usage of renewable energy, rather than GDP per capita.
